    <h2> Physical Characteristics & Adaptations</h2>
    <p><b>Speed:</b> Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 70 mph (113 km/h) in short bursts covering distances up to 1,500 ft (460 m).<br>

      <b>Build:</b> They have slender bodies, long legs, a small rounded head on a long neck, and a deep chest. Their spine is highly flexible, aiding in their explosive speed.<br>
      
      <b>Claws & Tail:</b> Unlike most big cats, cheetahs have semi-retractable claws for better grip during high-speed chases. Their long tail helps with balance and steering.<br>
      
      <b>Coloration:</b> Their tan coat with black spots provides camouflage in grassy environments.</p><br>

    <h2>Behavior & Diet</h2>
    <p><b>Hunting Style:</b> Cheetahs rely on sight rather than scent and prefer to hunt during the day (diurnal) to avoid competition from nocturnal predators like lions or hyenas.<br>

     <b>Prey:</b> They mainly hunt small to medium-sized ungulates such as gazelles, impalas, and young wildebeests.<br>
      
      <b>Social Structure:</b> Males may live in small groups called "coalitions," often made up of brothers. Females are generally solitary except when raising cubs.<br>
      
      <b>Vocalization:</b> Cheetahs donâ€™t roar like lions. Instead, they chirp, hiss, growl, and purr.</p><br>

  <section class="Topic 4">
    <h2>Habitat, Range & Conservation</h2>
    <p><b>Habitat:</b> Cheetahs prefer open savannas, grasslands, and sometimes dry forests. They need vast territories for hunting.<br>

      <b>Geographic Range:</b> Most cheetahs live in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small, critically endangered population in Iran.<br>
      
      <b>Threats:</b> Their population is threatened by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poaching, and loss of genetic diversity.<br>
      
      <b>Conservation Status:</b> Cheetahs are listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. There are fewer than 7,000 cheetahs left in the wild as of recent estimates.<br>
      
      <b>Efforts:</b> Conservation efforts include habitat preservation, anti-poaching measures, and breeding programs.</p><br>
